Copy and paste cookie values from a website to another.
Mainly used for frontend development when localhost trying to interact with backend through proxy middleware.

Currently it only copy JSESSIONID from source website and create JSESSIONID AND SID in the target website. Modify line 47 and 78 in popup.js to create more or difference cookie values.
